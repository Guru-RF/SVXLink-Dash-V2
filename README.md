# SVXLink-Dash-V2
SVXLink dashboard repository inspired by pi star dashboard built by Waldek SP2ONG, and modified for the latest versions of SVXLink
by Chris G4NAB. I've been building a dashboard around a Pi-Star Dashboard design for ages, then I found Waldek had already done it, but it needed tweaking.

Simply having installed SVXLink using the script on this repository: 
sudo git clone https://github.com/f5vmr/SVXLink-Dash-V2.git html 

To activate mDNS (host.local) use:
```
 sudo apt-get install avahi-daemon avahi-utils
```
For the SA818 Transmitter use this script.
RF configurator is based on sa818 programming library (https://github.com/0x9900/SA818)
```
sudo apt install python3
sudo apt install python3-pip
sudo pip3 install sa818
```

 

The svxlink dashboard created by SP2ONG, SP0DZ and mucked about a bit more by Chris JACKSON G4NAB/F5VMR.
