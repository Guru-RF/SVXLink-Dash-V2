# SVXLink_Dash-V2
SVXLink dashboard repository inspired by pi star dashboard built by Waldek SP2ONG, and modified for the latest versions of SVXLink. I have been working on a Pi-Star based dahsboard for weeks only to find that Waldek had already done it, although it requires some changes to the code.

Simply having installed SVXLink using the script on this repository: 
sudo git clone https://github.com/f5vmr/SVXLink-Dash-V2.git html 

To activate mDNS (host.local) use:
```
 sudo apt-get install avahi-daemon avahi-utils
```
For the SA818 Transmitter use this script.
RF configurator is based on sa818 programming library (https://github.com/0x9900/SA818)
```
sudo apt install python3
sudo apt install python3-pip
sudo pip3 install sa818
```

 

The svxlink dashboard created by SP2ONG, SP0DZ and mucked about a bit more by Chris JACKSON G4NAB/F5VMR.
